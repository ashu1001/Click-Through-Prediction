# Click-Through-Prediction in Online Hotel Rankings

Many of the online Hotel Booking sites like Expedia, Booking.com, TripAdvisor use machine learning approach to personalize the hotels for each user. This is done based on a number of factors like hotel location, user past purchase history, hotel features and competitor’s features. After evaluating all these factors, a list of hotels is presented to user based on his/her search parameters. 
In this project what we will try to achieve is that how accurately we are able to predict the Click-through for a particular hotel search result. Click-through means if a user clicks a hotel listing or not. The techniques used for this project will be classification algorithms like Logistic, Classification tree, Random Forests, Boosting, Naive Bayes and Neural Network. All of the model accuracy scores will be compared against each other to see which one gives the highest out-of-sample accuracy.
However, the exploratory data analysis part is equally important as the model results. Through, Exploratory Data Analysis we will try to answer what are the major factors that influence user’s decision to click on a hotel listing. Is it because of lower price? Or due to property location? Or maybe because it has higher ratings?
Combining both of our analysis, the final results will be presented showing the key factors influencing click-through and final model accuracy on predicting the click-through of those listings.
